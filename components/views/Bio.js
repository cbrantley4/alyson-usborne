      <ul>
        <li>Education</li>
        <p>
          I graduated from Penn State Beaver in 2006 with a BS in Psychology.

        <li>Life Experiences</li>
        <p>
          I worked in adult Psychiatric Care for 5 years after I graduated. I
          chose to make a career change as a full-time Nanny, where I worked for
          3 years. I am currently a stay at home mom that loves reading with her
          children.
        </p>
        <li>Career Goals</li>
        <p>
          The time I spent as a Nanny and a stay at home mom has taught me how
          important reading is to childhood development. It is for this reason
          that I chose to become a Consultant for Usborne. I hope to help more
          moms create this love of learning in their homes.
